Along with archival materials and field observations, online reviews are becoming an important source of data about the Red Triangle. They help us capture both individual visitor impressions and broader patterns in how people perceive this urban space.

Our Red Triangle review dataset contains 325 entries, with most coming from Google Maps and significantly fewer from Y‑maps. We used automatic sentiment classification on this feedback corpus, processing it in Python and visualizing results in R. Unlike the Design District DAA, the sentiment distribution here leans toward ambivalence rather than positivity. Positive reviews make up less than half the dataset, while neutral, negative, and mixed reviews together occupy a substantial portion. This statistical pattern already signals that public perception of the Red Triangle differs markedly from how people view DAA.

The content matches this distribution. While creative event spaces get described through vocabulary about "atmosphere" and "design," the Red Triangle appears in user descriptions as industrial ruins. Key words and themes revolve around "abandonment," "ruin," "limited access," "historicity," and "urban extreme." This creates a completely different discourse profile. Where DAA centered on "design—atmosphere—events," Red Triangle descriptions focus on the territory's material condition and ambivalent status as both an industrial heritage object and a problematic urban area.

Platform characteristics also play a role. Y‑maps has "naked ratings" without text (rating_only) like DAA, but the volume is noticeably smaller compared to the Google Maps corpus. This makes the imbalance between texts and star ratings less pronounced, with Google becoming our main source of discourse material. Methodologically, this means our Red Triangle analysis relies primarily on expanded Google Maps texts that shape the object's reputation profile.

Even at this initial data level, it's clear that Red Triangle's reputation develops differently from DAA's. Positive sentiment doesn't disappear, but it's not dominant, giving way to neutral and critical voices. This reflects the case's basic contradiction: Red Triangle attracts attention through its industrial history and scale, but users perceive it more as "abandoned" rather than a comfortable or institutionally supported urban space.

In Red Triangle reviews, codes related to quick rating possibilities dominate. The rating_only tag takes the top spot, just like with DAA. However, what follows is a different thematic territory. While atmosphere holds second place in frequency, categories related to post‑industrial environment perception are much stronger: reuse, danger, urban_exploration, abandonment, ruin, nostalgia, history, heritage. These codes define the corpus's specific vocabulary. Instead of a commercial and event focus like DAA, the emphasis shifts toward experiencing ruined space, the risks of staying, and the search for the past. References to danger and abandonment highlight the site's marginalized status, while nostalgia, heritage, and history signal cultural and memorial significance that coexist with decline. The presence of the codes `commerce` and `security` in the lower positions shows that the topics of everyday consumption and household security remain on the periphery: unlike DAA, here they do not form the core of perception.

Looking at the code distribution heat map by sentiment clarifies exactly how these thematic emphases relate to review tone. The positive column has almost nothing to do with commercial or everyday infrastructure topics. Instead, heritage, history, reuse, and individual mentions of "creative" or "cultural" potential stand out most prominently. !! This suggests that the positive responses in the KTR are primarily motivated by the value of the object as a historical heritage and the possibility of its reinterpretation, rather than current usage practices. The negative column, on the contrary, is saturated with the codes `danger`, `abandonment`, `ruin`, `decay`, which reflects the perception of space as unsafe, destroyed, and neglected.!! Neutral reviews are distributed mainly around the tags `atmosphere`, `urban_exploration', `architecture', fixing restrained descriptions of the environment and visual aesthetics without a pronounced assessment. Mixed attitudes tend to overlap the codes "danger" and "legacy", which indicates an ambivalent perception: users simultaneously note the value of the object and its problematic nature.

Unlike DAA, where the positive image was constructed through design aesthetics and event programming, Red Triangle's positive reviews connect much more closely to historical and cultural discourse, while negative reviews relate more to the object's physical condition. The heat map helps visually capture this gap: cultural codes feed positive attitudes, while material decline characteristics define negative ones. This confirms that Red Triangle public perception forms not around current "user value" like commerce or convenience, but around the "heritage vs. ruin" dilemma.

These differences extend beyond visual code and tone distribution—they're statistically confirmed, too. !! Using the χ² criterion lets us check how much stance distribution depends on the platform, and t-tests record rating differences between groups. Quantitative analysis complements graph interpretation, showing that the gap between "legacy and reinvention" and "decline and danger" has both a meaningful and statistically significant foundation.!!

Stance distribution between platforms differs statistically significantly: Chi-square (χ² = 87.19, df = 3, p < 0.001) shows that sentiment structure (positive, neutral, negative, and mixed reviews) forms differently on Google Maps and Y‑maps. This confirms our chart observations—Y‑maps discourse is more fragmented and heterogeneous, while Google provides a relatively more balanced distribution. This happens not just because of platform habits, but also because Y‑maps has higher proportions of "fives" without text, and negativity gets expressed more briefly, while Google users leave detailed neutral or mixed texts that get classified differently by the model. The platform itself structures the perceptual field: Y‑maps enhances "polarization" with short fives against short ones/twos, while Google captures more nuance.

Meanwhile, average rating values show no statistical difference: t-test (t = 1.22, df ≈ 240, p = 0.225) shows that average ratings on Google Maps (M = 4.20) and Y‑maps (M = 4.02) have no significant difference. Despite different stance distributions, final "star" ratings end up close. This suggests that for Red Triangle, text tonality and numerical rating partially diverge. Google captures more neutral and mixed formulations, but users still tend to give medium-high scores. Y‑maps shows laconic fives and ones/twos dominating, but their average levels out to the same roughly 4.0 range.

Different platform review cultures affect stance distribution, but numerical differences (ratings) get smoothed out. Red Triangle's reputation profile appears "medium-positive" when looking at ratings alone, but becomes much more conflicted and heterogeneous when analyzing textual tonalities.

!!The rating distribution graph by stance shows how text tonality relates to users' numerical ratings. For positive reviews, the median stays at 5 with minimal interquartile range—the vast majority of "positive" responses lock in at the scale's top.!! (The rating distribution graph, depending on position, allows you to see how the text tonality is related to the numerical ratings of users. For positive reviews, the median is kept at 5, while the interquartile range is minimal: the vast majority of "positive" responses are fixed at the top of the scale.) Even with wording variability, positive tone almost always pairs with maximum digital scores.

Neutral reviews show a wider range: the median sits near the top (about 4), but outliers appear at levels 1 and 2. This configuration indicates that some texts classified as neutral came with extremely low scores. This manifests the typical Red Triangle corpus situation: users could describe a place in "dry" or purely descriptive terms without obvious emotional markers, while simultaneously giving low ratings that record general dissatisfaction. Neutral vocabulary doesn't always match a neutral attitude in scoring.

Negative reviews form a compact cluster around median 2. The interquartile range is narrow, with almost all values concentrated in the low score zone (1–2). This confirms direct links between negative tone and digital discontent expression—users who explicitly criticize an object almost always record it with low scores.

Mixed reviews give the most interesting picture. The median here approaches 4–5, and although the value range is wider than for positive reviews, the upper scale portion still dominates. This can be interpreted as "ambivalent loyalty" effects—even mentioning disadvantages like danger, abandonment, or lack of security, mixed review authors tend to complete impressions with high ratings, emphasizing the object's attractiveness for research or creative practices.

The boxplot demonstrates an important Red Triangle feature: texts and numbers don't always align. Positivity and negativity get steadily fixed at scale extremes, but "neutral" formulations can accompany low scores, while "mixed" ones rise to maximum levels instead. Together, this reinforces the heterogeneous perception picture—Red Triangle gets simultaneously assessed as dangerous and problematic, but also as an attractive research and creative exploitation object.

The relationship between text tonality and digital ratings in Red Triangle reveals persistent gaps: negativity gets recorded through low scores, positivity through maximum scores, and neutral and mixed reviews occupy intermediate zones, often with contradictions. This inconsistency becomes especially significant in time dynamics—uneven expression directly affects the review curve over the years.

!! The graph shows Red Triangle's review corpus is extremely limited in volume and unevenly distributed over time. Unlike DAA, where response numbers grow alongside institutional activity, Red Triangle dynamics demonstrate long periods of near-complete silence.!! Until the 2010s, review numbers remained minimal, reflecting both low site recognition and a lack of systematic work integrating it into city programs.

Recent years show a change beginning: there's a slight response increase approaching 2020. This growth isn't related to institutional support (which doesn't exist for Red Triangle), but rather to intensifying "urban exploration" practices and local community interest in abandoned spaces. This period saw early online discussions where Red Triangle was described as a site of ruined aesthetics, a backdrop for photo shoots, or a magnet for researchers of the industrial past.

However, compared to DAA—where dynamics clearly correlate with events and programs—Red Triangle review dynamics look chaotic and fragmented. This confirms the lack of an institutional trajectory—neither city nor investors support systematic facility presence in public discourse. Therefore, each increase in review numbers is explained not by the object's internal "life," but by external waves of interest such as media publications, blogger activity, or bursts of "stalker" practices.

Red Triangle's temporal review dynamics highlight its marginal position in urban memory. Unlike DAA, reputation here forms not through a stable institutional framework, but through random and short-term waves of interest.

7.
The uneven and unsystematic review dynamics are directly reflected in the vocabulary users employ to describe Red Triangle. Unlike DAA, where stable atmosphere and design codes dominate, here words about ruins, abandonment, and experiencing exploration of an "alien" space take center stage. To understand exactly how this image develops, we need to examine word clouds—both across the entire review corpus and separately for Google Maps and Y‑maps.

The cumulative Red Triangle review word cloud immediately shows concentration on ruin and "alien" space exploration categories. Words indicating abandonment and decay appear frequently: "destruction," "abandoned," "ruins." These markers capture object perception as an industrial past symbol devoid of actual economic use. Alongside them appear words like "dangerous," "research," "urban," and "exploring," reflecting interest from urban researcher communities and extreme tourism fans. The general cloud immediately outlines two main perception frames: Red Triangle as an industrial decline monument on one hand, and as an "urban exploration" practice field on the other. Terms like "atmosphere" and "heritage" indicate that, alongside dangerous and degrading place imagery, cultural optics also form, where the object gets perceived as a carrier of historical memory and special urban flavor.

Considering the Google Maps cloud, emphasis shifts toward cultural and historical descriptions. !! References to "architecture," "history," "heritage," and "nostalgia" appear noticeably more often. This indicates that Google users more often perceive the Red Triangle as an urban memory element, significant in cultural or research contexts. Their discourse takes on a less everyday and more "observational" tone—not only a ruin, but a thread in !! St. Petersburg's historical narrative. This may reflect Google Maps audience specifics, where tourist and external observer proportions are higher, seeking unusual "points of interest."

Y‑maps provides a more prosaic and "local" picture. This platform's cloud shows words related to risks and direct visiting experience more prominently: "dangerous," "security guard," "security," and "territory." !!Here, emphasis falls on practical space contact aspects: how easy it is to get inside, what barriers exist, and what threats are associated with facility stays.!! References to "abandonment," "ruin," and "filth" show that for a significant portion of users, Red Triangle is primarily a place of decline and insecurity, rather than cultural value. !! Nevertheless, words like "atmosphere" and "history" also appear, indicating the presence of a cultural dimension, albeit secondary compared to the "at your own risk" experience.!! (Nevertheless, words like "atmosphere" and "history" are also recorded here, which indicates the presence of a cultural dimension, albeit secondary compared to the experience "at your own risk.")

Comparing the two platform clouds reveals discourse gaps: Google transmits Red Triangle as a "heritage site" and object of cultural attention; Y‑maps frames it as a "risk area" and "abandoned place" for local researchers. Unlike DAA, where platform differences manifested in varying emphasis on creativity versus everyday convenience, Red Triangle cases define fundamentally different ways of describing the same object. Collectively, this explains statistical stance distribution differences: where danger and ruins language prevails in texts, tone tends toward negative or neutral, and where heritage and architecture language is used, space opens for positive assessments.

Red Triangle's reputation profile forms around imagery of a ruined but exploration-attractive space. Unlike DAA, where positive tone is based on institutionally supported event and commercial programming, Red Triangle positive assessments more likely stem from the aura of industrial heritage and the place's uniqueness. Meanwhile, significant proportions of negative and neutral reviews record decline, security problems, and lack of development, highlighting the facility's discursive "vulnerability." Collectively, this forms dual imagery: simultaneously a platform for cultural imagination and a symbol of unfinished transformation, where the industrial past hasn't yet integrated into a stable urban identity.
